First, type mkdir NAME in the command prompt to create a new folder for the repo and cd NAME

to enter the folder. Then, open GitHub in browser and create a new repository. In the command

prompt, type echo "TEXT" >> README.md to save TEXT to a new README file. Then, type git init

to initialize an empty git repo in the current directory. Type git add README.md to add the

README file to get it ready to commit and then type git commit -m "initial commit" to commit.

Then, type git branch -M main to set the branch to main. Type git remote add origin \[SSH key]

to connect the local repository to GitHub. Finally, type git push -u origin main to push the

main branch to GitHub.



The workflow going forward is just to type git pull to pull the latest version. Change any

files, then type git add FILE to get it ready to commit. Type git commit -m "DESCRIPTION"

to commit and git push to GitHub.
